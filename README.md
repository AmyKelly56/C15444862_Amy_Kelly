# Sci-FI UI Design


Open file called C15444862 to run program. Opening blue particle diplayed on screen for 30 seconds. In this opening imported the Minium sound library in order to use sound while that animation plays out. After 30 seconds on screen prompt displayed using. Click on screen when "System Loaded" displayed, this will bring you to the main UI page. Slight lagging in loading of Galaxy Star located in the middle of the window. 

To interact with the program and change certain feature use the drop down menu on top left to change color circles on side of screen using the radio buttonts These drop down menus location on the top left and right are created using the CP5 library which I also imported and learned some of the functions such as this one known as accordion and modified. Use right drop down menu to moves sildes to change speed and throttle this increments and decrements the color of the bar and the numbers as it is dragged up and backwards.

Toggles on bottom right change color of the rotating arc radar in centre based on RGB values as each individual slider is dragged. Hover over, square on bottom middle.
Barchart on the bottom right reads in data from a CSV file to populate bars.

Galaxy star in middle rotates in as mouse moves around the screen. Stars around the galaxy are generated.
Frame of spaceship are drawn with lines and arcs and rotating arcs.
